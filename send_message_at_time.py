I know this is first because it's sent via a Python script running on my computer somewhere... though I'm not exactly sure where I (or my computer, for that matter) will be at this time haha. Happy birthday kid, you are a wonderful person and I always enjoy laughing together. I know you have a great day ahead of ya. Hopefully this worked? 

With love, 
Jacob
